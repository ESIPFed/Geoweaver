About the data:
This dataset represents the Adult Depression (LGHC Indicator) and shows the proportion of adults in California who were ever told they had a depressive disorder. Data was sourced from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) and collected by the Public Health Survey Research Program at California State University, Sacramento under contract with the CDPH. This indicator is drawn from the question about being informed by a health professional of having a depressive disorder, which includes conditions such as depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression. Note that the data for the denominator and weighting come from the California Department of Finance, and therefore may differ from those published in national BRFSS data tables by the CDC or other federal agencies.


The dataset adult-depression-lghc-indicator-24.csv consists of 161 observations and 8 variables.
