# How to Create a New Release in Geoweaver

To upgrade Geoweaver to a new version, follow these steps to update the necessary files and manage the release on GitHub.

1. **Update Version in Files**
    - Update the version number in both `gw.js` and `pom.xml` to the latest version (e.g., from `1.5.1` to `1.5.2`).

2. **Remove Latest Tag**
    - Navigate to the relevant directory to check out the latest master branch.
        ```bash
        cd ../rmlatest
        ```
    - Remove the `latest` tag from the remote repository.
        ```bash
        git push --delete origin latest
        ```
    This step ensures that the `latest` tag is freed up for the new release.

3. **Update Draft Release Tag**
    - Go to the [Geoweaver releases page](https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver/releases).
    - You will see that the old version (e.g., `v1.5.1`) is tagged as a draft because its tag was deleted.
    - Click on "Edit" and change the tag back to its original format, for example, `v1.5.1-pre`.
    - Publish these changes. This allows for proper version tracking while preparing the new release.

4. **Push File Changes**
    - Commit and push the changes made to `gw.js` and `pom.xml`.
    - Note: This action might trigger a workflow, which you can cancel if itâ€™s not needed at this point.

5. **Draft a New Release**
    - On GitHub, draft a new release.
    - Choose a new tag version (e.g., `v1.5.2-pre`) and select the previous tag version as the target (e.g., `v1.5.1`).
    - Generate the release notes and publish the release.
    - Wait for the `release_workflow` to complete.

6. **Update Release Tag to Latest**
    - Once the release workflow is finished, update the release tag (e.g., `v1.5.2-pre`) back to `latest`.
    - This ensures that PyGeoweaver and other installers will download the latest jar.
    - Click "Update release" to save the changes.

By following these steps, you ensure that the Geoweaver release process is smooth and all necessary updates are properly managed.
