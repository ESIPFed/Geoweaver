# [Geoweaver](https://esipfed.github.io/Geoweaver/)

**2018 ESIP Lab Incubator Project**

Geoweaver is an in-browser software allowing users to easily compose and execute full-stack data processing workflows by taking advantage of online spatial data facilities, high-performance computation platforms, and open-source deep learning libraries. It provides an all-in-one capacity covering server management, code repository, workflow orchestration software, and history recorder.

It can be run from both local and remote (distributed) machines.

GeoWeaver is a community effort. Any contribution is welcome and greatly appreciated!

# Software Goals

Only two fundamental objectives:

1. Make it time affordable for scientists with less-coding experience (who are unaware of WfMS) to manage their data processing workflows.

2. Preserve every model run history and share them along with the code files.
