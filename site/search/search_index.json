Geoweaver Online API Table of Contents Software Goals Installation Dependencies Quick Install (Recommended) Developer Install Linux Mac Windows Docker Tomcat War Cloud VM Template Build from source Demo Tutorial Citation Dependencies License Software Goals 1) turning large-scale distributed deep network into manageable modernized workflows; 2) boosting higher utilization ratio of the existing cyberinfrastructures by separating scientists from tedious technical details; 3) enhancing the frequency and accuracy of classified land cover land use maps for agricultural purposes; 4) enabling the tracking of provenance by recording the execution logs in structured tables to evaluate the quality of the result maps; 5) proof the effectiveness of operationally using large-scale distributed deep learning models in classifying Landsat image time series. Installation Dependencies Java 1.8+ (OpenJDK 8 or higher) !(only for install via docker) Docker 18.09.1+ !(only for install via docker) Docker-compose 1.23.1+ Quick Install (Recommended) Step 1: Download the latest version of geoweaver.jar Step 2: Run the command: java -jar geoweaver.jar Step 3: Open browser and enter: http://localhost:8070/Geoweaver/ .That's it! Developer Install This section is dedicated for developer users who have better background on web technologies and familiar with MySQL, H2, tomcat, docker, and maven. If you are familiar with neither of them, we strongly suggest you use the \"Quick Install\" way to install Geoweaver. Linux This way works for most linux releases, e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat, OpenBSD, etc. Step 1: clone the github repo git clone https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver.git Step 2: enter the folder and start the install cd Geoweaver chmod 755 install-linux.sh ./install-linux.sh Once the script stops, Geoweaver should already be up and running. Enter URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/Geoweaver/web/geoweaver in browser to open it. Optional: To stop Geoweaver, type: install/apache-tomcat-9.0.22/bin/shutdown.sh . To start Geoweaver again, type: install/apache-tomcat-9.0.22/bin/startup.sh Mac Step 1: clone the github repo git clone https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver.git Step 2: enter the folder and start the install cd Geoweaver chmod 755 install-mac.sh ./install-mac.sh Once the script stops, the Geoweaver should already be up and running. Enter URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/Geoweaver/web/geoweaver in browser to open it. Optional: To stop Geoweaver, type: install/apache-tomcat-9.0.22/bin/shutdown.sh . To start Geoweaver again, type: install/apache-tomcat-9.0.22/bin/startup.sh Windows Step 1: clone the github repo git clone https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver.git Step 2: enter the folder and start the install cd Geoweaver ./install-windows.bat Once the script stops, the Geoweaver should already be up and running. Enter URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/Geoweaver/web/geoweaver in browser to open it. Optional: To stop Geoweaver, type: install/apache-tomcat-9.0.22/bin/shutdown.bat . To start Geoweaver again, type: install/apache-tomcat-9.0.22/bin/startup.bat Docker We use docker-compose to establish the containers for Geoweaver. As the DockerHub is not very friendly for docker-compose yaml at present, we only suggest manual to start from GitHub repo. It only has three steps. Install Clone this repo to your machine git clone https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver.git Enter the repo and create a new folder target . Download a Geoweaver war package from the release page and save it in the created target folder. cd Geoweaver && mkdir target && cd target wget https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver/releases/download/v0.7.1/Geoweaver.war -O Geoweaver.war Run docker to start rolling. After the command is finished, Geoweaver should be up and running. cd .. && docker-compose up -d The address is: http://your-ip:your-port/Geoweaver/web/geoweaver Replace the your-ip , your-port with the real domain of your tomcat. For example, localhost:8080 . Notice: Make sure the local services like mysql and tomcat are shut down before starting docker-compose . Otherwise there might be port conflict error on 3306 and 8080 . Or you can change the port to some other free ports in the docker-compose.yml. If you don't have docker or docker-compose installed, these documents will help. docker docker-compose Shutdown To stop Geoweaver, type: docker stop $(docker ps -aq) Tomcat War Install Download the latest release war and copy it to the webapps directory of Tomcat (e.g. /usr/local/tomcat). Start Tomcat. wget https://github.com/ESIPFed/Geoweaver/releases/download/v0.7.1/Geoweaver.war -O Geoweaver.war cp Geoweaver.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh After the tomcat is fully started, configure the database connection. The configuration files are WEB-INF/classes/config.properties nano /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/Geoweaver/WEB-INF/classes/config.properties nano /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/Geoweaver/WEB-INF/classes/cc_secret.properties Fill the fields with correct values. (database url, default: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cyberconnector) and WEB-INF/classes/cc_secret.properties (database username and password: database_user=root database_password=xxxxxxxx). ( Note: the MySQL database must be initiated by the SQL file under the folder Geoweaver/docker/db first. If you are using H2 database, please copy the two files: geoweaver.mv.db and geoweaver.trace.db to your user home directory before you start tomcat. ) mysql -u root -p < docker/db/gw.sql Enter the following URL into browser address bar to open Geoweaver: http://your-ip:your-port/Geoweaver/web/geoweaver Shutdown To stop Geoweaver, use: /usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh Cloud VM Template Install We provide a ready-to-use cloud template for you to install on mainstream cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, OpenStack and CloudStack. Please go here to download the template (3.1 Gigabytes). The username and password of the instance would be csiss and password respectively. To start Geoweaver, go to directory /home/csiss/Geoweaver and execute docker-compose up -d. With no accident, Geoweaver will be up and running. cd /home/csiss/Geoweaver && docker-compose up -d Shutdown To stop Geoweaver, use: docker stop $(docker ps -aq) Build from source Use maven to build. In the command line go to the root folder and execute mvn install . After a success build, the Geoweaver jar package will be under the directory: Geoweaver/target/Geoweaver-<version>.jar .
